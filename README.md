# Python Scripts for creating Bounding Box Windows Executable Files

This repository consist of a python scripts for creating Windows or Mac graphical user interface (GUI) executable files that can be used to create rectangular bounding box around 2D images from csv file with image paths. This GUI is particularly useful for easy annotation/bounding box creation of de-identified image data without annotators knowledge of image information. This type of annotator are regularly used for creating labels or ground truth bounding box in many object detaction algorithm in deep learning or machine learning models. The entire script can be runned using python. The needed packages for creating a custom changes in the program is detailed below.

The executable file can be created in two steps: 

I. Base Python Script/Development Step

II. Executable Deployment Step

To create executable file without any custom changes refer (II. Executable Deployment Step without changes to provided script). However, in case of introducing user based custom changes in executable files all necessary modification needed to be made in (I. Base Pyton Script prior to II. Executable Deployment Step). 

Use of source/executable files, with or without modification are permitted.

**Scripts are prepared using python and tkinter libraries**

### I. BASE PYTHON SCRIPT




### II. EXECUTABLE DEPLOYMENT
